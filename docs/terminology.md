## Terminology

Potentials ones to consider

* Validator
* Constraint
* Violation
* Validation(s)
* Validate
* Constraint Violation
* Rule(s)
* RuleSet
* RuleBuilder
* Hint (Spring Validation or is it Hibernate Validator?)
* PropertyValidator

Idea: Maybe use a sentence breakdown / anatomy structure diagram in the docs to showcase terminology/language used
